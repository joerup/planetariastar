# ‚≠êÔ∏è Planetaria Star ‚≠êÔ∏è

### WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge Winner ü•á

I created a playground called Planetaria Star which teaches users about how stars work in the universe. My playground was built using the Swift Playgrounds app for Mac and the SwiftUI framework. I used SwiftUI views to display content in the playground, and I used a json file created by myself to hold many different stars‚Äô property data. I was inspired to create this playground because of my love of space and astronomy. I am always so awestruck learning about the incredible processes that take place in the universe, and I thought that this playground would be the perfect opportunity to display the wonder of the stars in the sky. The playground walks the user through the properties of stars and allows them to play with different attributes to see how it influences the model star being displayed. It teaches them the importance of stellar properties and the dependence of color on temperature. Then, it shows them the H-R Diagram, a chart for categorizing stars, and explains how different stars are grouped together by their properties. The json data is decoded from the file and passed into Star objects to be displayed on the chart. The diagram displays a trend between luminosity and temperature found in nature, and gives users a sense of how stars‚Äô properties actually compare. Next, the user is asked to write code to observe the process of nucleosynthesis: the fusion of nuclei in stellar cores; and they then view the simulation. The simulation of nuclear fusion was made possible by SwiftUI animations and circle objects, which are sent to different parts of the screen and annihilated as the code executes. This teaches users the importance of the nuclear reactions in a star‚Äôs life, as it is through this process that energy is emitted by the star. I have always been amazed by the fact that these reactions are so crucial: our very existence depends on them, and I hope to communicate that to users. Finally, the program simulates the evolutionary stages in a star‚Äôs life, both for low mass and high mass stars; it culminates in a supernova. To accomplish this, I used SwiftUI animations and shapes that are influenced to appear like a supernova explosion. Again, this is another element crucial to our existence; without supernovae, heavier elements would never have formed in the universe, matter would not be able to travel across galaxies, and we would never exist. We literally owe our lives to the gargantuan explosion of a high-mass star via supernova, as well as the constant flow of light and heat emitted by all stars. Our dependence on the stars for our existence is so amazing to me, and it really puts our lives into perspective. With my playground‚Äôs features of modeling the various aspects of stars: properties, classification, energy, and evolution, I hope users of the program will gain an appreciation for those tiny sparks in the night sky.
